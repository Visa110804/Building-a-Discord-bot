# Building-a-Discord-bot

This is a python mini project builds a Discord bot for your Discord Server.
What is a Dsicord Bot?
A bot is nothing more than a computer program that performs some useful actions. It automatically does things in your server without needing a person to do them manually.
Discord wants bots to be able to do useful things, they have allowed developers to access parts of its system in their code, such as automatically responding to messages or helping with the server's admin functions.
This bot is a MEMEBOT that send memes on text recieved. It can read and write messages as and how the users text on the channel.
I have made used of the open source meme-api for the random generation of memes.
